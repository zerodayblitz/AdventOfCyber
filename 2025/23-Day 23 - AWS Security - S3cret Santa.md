# Day 23 - AWS Security - S3cret Santa
## Overview
Day 23 focused on AWS security fundamentals such as accounts, IAM, and S3 access from the attacker/assessor perspective.
## Objective and What I Did
Through the AWS CLI, I enumerated IAM permissions and assumed roles, and this ultimately accessing a file stored in S3. Through the target machine and using verified credentials, I explored IAM entities and polices via the AWS CLI. From which I then used allowed actions to assume further roles and retrieve an object from an S3 bucket.
## Key Takeaway
Enumerating IAM privileges with AWS CLI is essential to understanding what a compromised identity can achieve.
