# Day 10 - SOC Alert Triaging - Tinsel Triage
## Overview
Day 10 covers alert triaging, including understanding the different types of alerts and categorizing them based on their severity and potential impact.
## Objective and What I Did
Day 10 began with understanding alert triggering and its factors:
- Severity Level - review the alert's severity rating, ranging from informational to critical. | **How bad?**
- Timestamp and Frequency - Identify when the alert was triggered and check for related activity. | **When?**
- Attack Stage - Determine which stage of the attack lifecycle this alert indicates. | **Where in the attack lifecycle?**
- Affected Asset - Identify the system, user, or resource involved and assess its importance to operations. | **Who or what is affected?**

After this understanding, I jumped into Day 10's task, which was using Microsoft Azure to view the lab logs. Where I navigated around Azure to find the answers to Day 10's task.
## Key Takeaway
Day 10 emphasized the importance of logging and alert triage. Security personnel must understand the usefulness of the categorization of alerts to avoid allocating too much time to what is not important.
