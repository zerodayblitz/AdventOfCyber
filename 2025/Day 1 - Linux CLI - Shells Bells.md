# Day 1 - Linux CLI - Shells Bells
## Overview
Day 1 covered introductory Linux terminal commands and their purposes. 
## Objective and What I Did
Day 1 focused on finding what happened to McSkidy. By interacting with the Linux terminal, I searched through directories to find the last message left by McSkidy and used it to find other clues to reveal the flag. I navigated through the directories and found McSkidy's guide left behind, which was a hidden file. I used the information found there to find the next steps. I navigated through directories and found the shell script necessary to find the flag
## Important Commands Used/Covered
- ````ls```` -  list files and directories
- ````cat```` - displays content of files
- ````grep```` - searches for text patterns
- ````history```` - shows previously executed commands

## Key Takeaways
From Day 1, the main theme was interaction and familiarity with basic Linux commands. Feeling comfortable with changing directories, opening files, changing user, reading command history, and more.
