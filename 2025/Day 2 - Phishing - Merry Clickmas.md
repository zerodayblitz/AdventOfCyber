# Day 2 - Phishing - Merry Clickmas
## Overview
Day 2 was quite fun for us pentesters. This one was a great introduction to phishing procedures. Where I used the Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) to send phishing emails and harvest credentials.
## Objective and What I Did
This room focused on introducing users to phishing and its procedures. The objective was to act as a red teamer and conduct a phishing focused pentest on TBFC staff. Using the Linux terminal, I first used a prewritten Python script that, when run on the target machine, opened a dupe TBFC portal login page. I ran the Python script, which opened the listener for any harvested information. Following this, I used the SET to build a phishing email in which I spear-phished the TBFC employees. I disguised and tailored the email to one that would most plausibly leave the employee susceptible to the trap, and lo and behold, they fell for it.
## Key Takeaways
Phishing is easy, it's deceptive, and prevalent every day. Because of this, everyone, not just security professionals, must have an adequate ability to spot phishing of all kinds. This is because the main target for phishing attacks is humans. Even though most phishing attacks still actualize via digital means, the backbone of the success of the attack is contingent upon the person or people deceived.
