# Day 24 - Exploitation with cURL - Hoperation Eggsploit
## Overview
The final day of AoC 2025 taught manual web exploitation using cURL to interact with endpoints, manage sessions, brute-force login, to bypass basic controls. It focuses on crafting HTTP GET and POST requests using cURL, viewing raw responses, and achieving things without the browser.
## Objective and What I Did
I was tasked with using cURL to interact with multiple web application endpoints to answer flags. I sent POST request with credentials, saved and reused cookies. I also automated a brute-force loop using a provided shell script and modified the User-Agent header to get different responses.
## Key Takeaway
Understanding how HTTP requests, cookies, and feeds work at the command line using cURL builds strong fundamentals for web hacking.
