# Day 13 - YARA Rules - YARA mean one!
## Overview
Day 13 gave an introduction to YARA rules, their importance, and how to write them.
## Objective and What I Did
The first task of Day 13 asked me to find how many images contained a specific string within a specific directory on the TryHackMe VM. I began by writing a short YARA rule that I was able to run that gave me the answer to this. The next task asked me to tailor a regex string that began with ````TBFC:```` followed by one or more alphanumeric ASCII characters. Lastly, I was tasked with finding what the message sent by McSkidy was. In which I had to edit my YARA rule in order to find.
## Key Takeaway
Day 13 emphasized the importance of YARA Rules. Their versatility and customizability make them a useful tool for blue teamers, doing things that many antivirus services do not offer.
