# Day 4 - AI in Security - old sAInt nick
## Overview
Day 4 provided users with an introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its role in cybersecurity. Broken down into three sections:
- Red Team
- Blue Team
- Software Security 
## Objective and What I Did
Day 4's task began in the TryHackMe VM, where I interacted with Van SolveIT, an AI chatbot that showcased the three sections covered on Day 4.
### Red Team
Here, the chatbot first identified the vulnerability for me. It identified that the username field of the web server was vulnerable to SQL injection. After, the bot wrote me a Python script that I could run to exploit this vulnerability.
### Blue Team
Here, the chatbot helped me analyze log data and explained it to me. Specifically, using the data from the attack I had run from the Red Team section of Day 4. The AI chatbot told me the IP address of the machine I ran the script from, the time, the attack itself, and more.
### Software Security
Here, the chatbot identified the vulnerability in the code that allowed the injection to take place. An empty string in the code allowed anyone to inject malicious SQL code. The improper sanitization was identified solely by the AI chatbot, which showed the strength of the tool.
## Key Takeaways
AI has a tremendous role in cybersecurity. In all facets of the field, let it be red team, blue team, or software security, AI can do a tremendous deal for security professionals. So cybersecurity professionals must utilize AI because it is an asset to the industry.
