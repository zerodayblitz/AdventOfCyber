# Day 21 - Malware Analysis - Malhare.exe
## Overview
Day 21's task focused on malware analysis and forensics using an HTA sample named ````survey.hta````
## Objective and What I Did
I was tasked with reverse engineering the HTA, identifying metadata, script functions, and network activity, amongst other things. Using the TryHackMe AttackBox, I opened the ````survery.hta```` file in a text editor and examined the code structure, encoding the strings and any URLs and commands to solve the THIRTEEN questions for this room.
## Key Takeaway
Simple HTA files often hide powerful scripted behavior, so for blue teamers, they must analyze metadata, logic, and network indicators for early detection and eventual response.
