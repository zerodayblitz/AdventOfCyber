# Day 6 - Malware Analysis - Egg-xecutable
## Overview
Day 6 focused on malware analysis. I went through Blue Team operations, performing both static and dynamic analysis in a sandbox.  
## Objective and What I Did
I began by  loading into the TryHackMe VM, where I first performed static analysis by using the petstudio application. I analyzed the sample's checksum and strings. Which were a few of the multitude of information that could be analyzed statistically (without running the file). Following this, I performed the dynamic analysis, in which I began by using RegShot to take two snapshots of the virtual OS. One before executing the executable and one after, and compared them. Lastly, using ProcMon, I discovered the operations the executable performed 
## Key Takeaway
The primary objective of Day6's task is to explore malware analysis. Specifically, the importance of engaging with malware in a secure space, like a sandbox. Knowing how to engage with it statically and dynamically, and properly.
