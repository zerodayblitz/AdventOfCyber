# Day 22 - C2 Detection - Command & Carol
## Overview
Day 22 focused on C2 detection using and introducing Real Intelligence Threat Analytics (RITA) through Zeek logs.
## Objective and What I Did
I was tasked with converting the provided PCAP into Zeek logs, importing them into RITA, and using RITA's output to identify C@ indicators that helped me answer the questions.
## Key Takeaway
Automatic PCAP analysis using Zeek plus RITA is crucial for scaling threat hunting and swiftly surfacing rather stealthy C2 channels hidden in noisy network data.
