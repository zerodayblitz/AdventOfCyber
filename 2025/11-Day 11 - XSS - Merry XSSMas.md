# Day 11 - XSS - Merry XSSMas
## Overview
Day 11's tasks focused solely on introducing XSS attacks, how they work, and how to prevent them.
## Objective and What I Did
I began today's task by going to the web app on the TryHackMe VM. Where I engaged with a web app that allowed for user input that was not properly sanitized. It was vulnerable to both stored and reflected XSS, which I was tasked with exploiting to achieve Day 11's flags.
## Key Takeaway
Input sanitization is imperative for security professionals and web developers. When your web page allows for user input, it opens a whole world of security risks, from XSS exploitation to SQL injection, and all need to be patched adequately.
