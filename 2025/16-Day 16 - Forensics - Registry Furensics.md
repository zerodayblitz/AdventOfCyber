# Day 16 - Forensics - Registry Furensics
## Overview
Day 16 introduced users to the Windows Registry, the Registry Editor, registry forensics, and more.
## Objective and What I Did
Day 16's task required me to analyze the registry hives from the compromised TryHackMe VM using the Registry Explorer Tool. As I uploaded my registry hive, I was tasked with navigating through the folders to find the answers to Day 16's questions.
## Key Takeaway
The Windows Registry is a powerful tool in blue team/digital forensic fields. The ability to log and access a comprehensive history of actions on the computer in one organized place is a crucial tool for security professionals. Getting the hang of such a tool can be a gem for those getting into blue team professions.
