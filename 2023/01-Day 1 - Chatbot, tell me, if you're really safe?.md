# Day 1 - Chatbot, tell me, if you're really safe?
## Overview
TryHackMe Advent of Cyber Day 1 kicked off by introducing me to the vulnerabilities that lie within AI chatbot input. AI consistently proves its revolutionary talent; however, all the good that has come with the technology doesn't nulify the inherent risk AI chatbots can bring.
## Objective and What I Did
Day 1 began with me engaging with the TryHackMe VM, in which I interacted with their vulnerable AI chatbot. By simply talking to the AI chatbot and prompt enginnering my request to retrieve the desired responses, allowed me to retrieve Day 1's flags.
## Key Takeaways
The overall takeaway of this day is consistent throughout information security: every new convenience or capability introduces a new risk. AI continues to be a monumental tool, and while enjoying the multitude of good it brings, we must properly sanitize and secure it.
